                            <p>Radianté is a cosmetics and skincare company that specializes in awakening clean and natural ingredients in makeup and skincare. The company strives to make makeup afforable, clean, organic, while still staying fresh and modern. With it's goals to be inclusive, Radianté has partnered with many individuals who come from different backgrounds and lifestyles. Radianté has decided on making a brand that stays relevant, but mature and simple for everyone to enjoy. As for website design, they have asked for something that can be notable but, easy to navigate. All mockups were created within <a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank" class="bold">Figma</a>.</p>
                            <br>

                            <p>Within the early process of the brainstorming, a plan was created to research similar companies to Radianté. Some of these companies can be found in drug stores across America and in cosmetic and upscale stores found in shopping districts. The branding ideas came to fruition when a typeface was declared for the brand. Once the typeface was chosen, a letter mark logo was founded by isolating all letters of Radianté except for the R.</p>

                            <p>With a typeface and logo created, colors started to develop. Shades of blue with black and white became the palette chosen for Radianté. The company needed to keep the branding interesting, while staying within the limits of clean and fresh. When the word skincare is presented, most think of hydration and water and water tends to have a blue hue to it. This is what impacted the decision on the specific palette.</p>

                            <p>Radianté's reputation for their branding is based in science, cosmetics and skincare. The idea for the website is a reflection of how the brand wants to be seen. Keeping the website minimal and clean of distractions was purposely implemented to create a refreshing and calmness to the eye. The white negative space acts as a clean canvas where the art is ready to be done, almost like a clean face before the cosmetics. The website was made in mind to keep it simple to use for those who struggle navigating websites regulary.</p>
