                    <h2>ASU GIT Senior Project</h2>

                            <p><a href="https://www.tsoynami.com/" target="_blank" class="bold">NAMI</a> is a vegan bakery and ice cream shop, created in Phoenix, Arizona. The idea behind the company started from the tSoynami ice cream which consists of a vegan ice cream base and with additional treats mixed in it such as cookies, cakes, chocolate, peanut butter, and other delicious treats. The company has achieved their success of making more vegan items available for customers such as cakes, cookies, cupcakes, and breakfast items. Nami has recently created their own cookie dough, named NamiDoh, that can be eaten raw but also, baked at home for those days when staying in and watching movies sounds more relaxing.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The idea behind this rebrand was to showcase a new and creative idea for the company, while still keeping it fresh, bright, and simple which is how the company currently stands now.</p>

                            <p>The process started with a slight creative brief of the project. This process included researching the company, finding out how to appeal to both new and older generations. The idea was to raise the company above small shop competitions and compete with bigger corporations such as Starbucks, Dunkin Donut, Baskin-Robbins, and Cold Stone Creamery.</p>

                            <p>After researching the company and it's place in the market, the process moved into sketches for a new logo. This included bringing vegan imagery and ice cream imagery into the logo. This logo was then placed into Adobe Illustrator, which was converted into a vector graphic. While in Illustrator, brainstorming of a color palette came into play. This is where typefaces, logo elements, and other brainstorming ideas were decided on.</p>

                            <p>The process was then shifted into recreating the website. This included making the new website in a Responsive format. Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop were the three responsive designs created to show a UI that can be implemented into a modern format. To keep things simple, sketches were drawn to show how the website could look before finalization.</p>
